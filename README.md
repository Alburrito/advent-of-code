Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for each year. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that provides a series of programming puzzles for the month of December.

All the solutions are implemented in Python. I've also included the description of the challenge for each day, which can be found in the `README.md` file for each day.

These may not be the most efficient solutions, but they are the ones I came up with while enjoying the challenges. I hope you find them useful but remember, if you are stuck on a challenge, just give it a break and come back to it later.

## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun and educational challenge that encourages problem-solving, algorithm design, and coding in a variety of programming languages. In this repository, you'll find my solutions implemented in Python.

You can clone this repository and run the Python solutions for each day by navigating to the respective day's directory and executing the `main.py` file.

In the context of Advent of Code, it's important to know that while the <b>puzzles are the same for all participants</b>, each of us receives a <b>personalized input</b> from the Advent of Code site. This personalized input means that your approach and solution to a given puzzle will be unique to you. This means that even if you have the same programming language and approach as someone else, <b>your answers will be different</b>.

Happy coding and best of luck with your Advent of Code journey!

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by year and day and contains a python file with the solutions (rare cases have multiple files), the input I got for the challenge, and a `README.md` file with the description of the challenge, retrieved from the web.
